# life-insurance-premium-estimator
Excel-based CM1 actuarial model for term life premium estimation

This project is an actuarial model built in Excel to estimate the *net premium* for a *term life insurance policy, based on mortality data and interest rate assumptions. It aligns with topics from the *CM1 (Actuarial Mathematics)* actuarial exam papers.

##  Features

- Calculates the *Expected Present Value (EPV)* of death benefits using life table mortality rates.
- Computes level *net premiums* for term insurance using annuity-due functions.
- Implements Excel tools like VLOOKUP, IFERROR.
